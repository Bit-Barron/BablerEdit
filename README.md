For translations, these are your best free options:
- Qwen/Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct - Good general-purpose model
- Qwen/Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct - If you need technical translations
- glm-4-flash, glm-4.5-flash - GLM models typically good at translations
- internlm/internlm2_5-7b-chat - Another solid choice
- tencent/Hunyuan-MT-7B - "MT" suggests it's specifically trained for machine translation
